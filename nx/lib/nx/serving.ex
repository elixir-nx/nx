defmodule Nx.Serving do
  @moduledoc """
  Serving encapsulates client and server work to perform batched requests.

  Servings can be executed on the fly, without starting a server, but most
  often they are used to run servers that batch requests until a given size
  or timeout is reached.

  More specifically, servings are a mechanism to apply a computation on a
  `Nx.Batch`, with hooks for preprocessing input from and postprocessing
  output for the client. Thus we can think of an instance of `t:Nx.Serving.t/0`
  (a serving) as something that encapsulates batches of Nx computations.

  ## Inline/serverless workflow

  First, let's define a simple numerical definition function:

      defmodule MyDefn do
        import Nx.Defn

        defnp print_and_multiply(x) do
          x = print_value(x, label: "debug")
          x * 2
        end
      end

  The function prints the given tensor and doubles its contents.
  We can use `new/1` to create a serving that will return a JIT
  or AOT compiled function to execute on batches of tensors:

      iex> serving = Nx.Serving.new(fn opts -> Nx.Defn.jit(&MyDefn.print_and_multiply/1, opts) end)
      iex> batch = Nx.Batch.stack([Nx.tensor([1, 2, 3])])
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, batch)
      debug: #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [1, 2, 3]
        ]
      >
      #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [2, 4, 6]
        ]
      >

  We started the serving by passing a function that receives
  compiler options and returns a JIT or AOT compiled function.
  We called `Nx.Defn.jit/2` passing the options received as
  argument, which will customize the JIT/AOT compilation.

  You should see two values printed. The former is the result of
  `Nx.Defn.Kernel.print_value/1`, which shows the tensor that was
  actually part of the computation and how it was batched.
  The latter is the result of the computation.

  When defining a `Nx.Serving`, we can also customize how the data is
  batched by using the `client_preprocessing` as well as the result by
  using `client_postprocessing` hooks. Let's give it another try:

      iex> serving = (
      ...>   Nx.Serving.new(fn opts -> Nx.Defn.jit(&MyDefn.print_and_multiply/1, opts) end)
      ...>   |> Nx.Serving.client_preprocessing(fn input -> {Nx.Batch.stack(input), :client_info} end)
      ...>   |> Nx.Serving.client_postprocessing(&{&1, &2, &3})
      ...> )
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, [Nx.tensor([1, 2]), Nx.tensor([3, 4])])
      debug: #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[2][2]
        [
          [1, 2],
          [3, 4]
        ]
      >
      {#Nx.Tensor<
         s64[2][2]
         [
           [2, 4],
           [6, 8]
         ]
       >,
       :server_info,
       :client_info}

  You can see the results are a bit different now. First of all, notice that
  we were able to run the serving passing a list of tensors. Our custom
  `client_preprocessing` function stacks those tensors into a batch of two
  entries and returns a tuple with a `Nx.Batch` struct and additional client
  information which we represent as the atom `:client_info`. The default
  client preprocessing simply enforces a batch was given and returns no client
  information.

  Then the result is a triplet tuple, returned by the client
  postprocessing function, containing the result, the server information
  (which we will later learn how to customize), and the client information.
  From this, we can infer the default implementation of `client_postprocessing`
  simply returns the result, discarding the server and client information.

  So far, `Nx.Serving` has not given us much. It has simply encapsulated the
  execution of a function. Its full power comes when we start running our own
  `Nx.Serving` process. That's when we will also learn why we have a `client_`
  prefix in some of the function names.

  ## Stateful/process workflow

  `Nx.Serving` allows us to define an Elixir process to handle requests.
  This process provides several features, such as batching up to a given
  size or time, partitioning, and distribution over a group of nodes.

  To do so, we need to start a `Nx.Serving` process with a serving inside
  a supervision tree:

      children = [
        {Nx.Serving,
         serving: Nx.Serving.new(fn opts ->  Nx.Defn.jit(&MyDefn.print_and_multiply/1, opts) end),
         name: MyServing,
         batch_size: 10,
         batch_timeout: 100}
      ]

      Supervisor.start_child(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  > Note: in your actual application, you want to make sure
  > `Nx.Serving` comes early in your supervision tree, for example
  > before your web application endpoint or your data processing
  > pipelines, as those processes may end-up hitting Nx.Serving.

  Now you can send batched runs to said process:

      iex> batch = Nx.Batch.stack([Nx.tensor([1, 2, 3]), Nx.tensor([4, 5, 6])])
      iex> Nx.Serving.batched_run(MyServing, batch)
      debug: #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[2][3]
        [
          [1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6]
        ]
      >
      #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[2][3]
        [
          [2, 4, 6],
          [8, 10, 12]
        ]
      >

  In the example, we pushed a batch of 2 and eventually got a reply.
  The process will wait for requests from other processes, for up to
  100 milliseconds or until it gets 10 entries. Then it merges all
  batches together and once the result is computed, it slices and
  distributes those responses to each caller.

  If there is any `client_preprocessing` function, it will be executed
  before the batch is sent to the server. If there is any `client_postprocessing`
  function, it will be executed after getting the response from the
  server.

  ### Partitioning

  You can start several partitions under the same serving by passing
  `partitions: true` when starting the serving. The number of partitions
  will be determined according  your compiler and for which host it is
  compiling.

  For example, when creating the serving, you may pass the following
  `defn_options`:

      Nx.Serving.new(computation, compiler: EXLA, client: :cuda)

  Now when booting up the serving:

      children = [
        {Nx.Serving,
         serving: serving,
         name: MyServing,
         batch_size: 10,
         batch_timeout: 100,
         partitions: true}
      ]

  If you have two GPUs, `batched_run/3` will now gather batches and send
  them to the GPUs as they become available to process requests.

  ### Distribution

  All `Nx.Serving`s are distributed by default. If the current machine
  does not have an instance of `Nx.Serving` running, `batched_run/3` will
  automatically look for one in the cluster. The nodes do not need to run
  the same code and applications. It is only required that they run the
  same `Nx` version.

  The load balancing between servings is done randomly, however, the number
  of partitions are considered if the `partitioned: true` option is also given.
  For example, if you have a node with 2 GPUs and another with 4, the latter
  will receive the double of requests compared to the former.

  `batched_run/3` receives an optional `distributed_preprocessing` callback as
  third argument for preprocessing the input for distributed requests. When
  using libraries like EXLA or Torchx, the tensor is often allocated in memory
  inside a third-party library so it is necessary to either transfer or copy
  the tensor to the binary backend before sending it to another node.
  This can be done by passing either `Nx.backend_transfer/1` or `Nx.backend_copy/1`
  as third argument:

      Nx.Serving.batched_run(MyDistributedServing, input, &Nx.backend_copy/1)

  Use `backend_transfer/1` if you know the input will no longer be used.

  Similarly, the serving has a `distributed_postprocessing` callback which can do
  equivalent before sending the reply to the caller.

  The servings are dispatched using Erlang Distribution. You can use
  `Node.connect/1` to manually connect nodes. In a production setup, this is
  often done with the help of libraries like [`libcluster`](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster).

  ## Advanced notes

  ### Module-based serving

  In the examples so far, we have been using the default version of
  `Nx.Serving`, which executes the given function for each batch.

  However, we can also use `new/2` to start a module-based version of
  `Nx.Serving` which gives us more control over both inline and process
  workflows. A simple module implementation of a `Nx.Serving` could look
  like this:

      defmodule MyServing do
        @behaviour Nx.Serving

        defnp print_and_multiply(x) do
          x = print_value({:debug, x})
          x * 2
        end

        @impl true
        def init(_inline_or_process, :unused_arg, [defn_options]) do
          {:ok, Nx.Defn.jit(&print_and_multiply/1, defn_options)}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_batch(batch, 0, function) do
          {:execute, fn -> {function.(batch), :server_info} end, function}
        end
      end

  It has two functions. The first, `c:init/3`, receives the type of serving
  (`:inline` or `:process`) and the serving argument. In this step,
  we capture `print_and_multiply/1`as a jitted function.

  The second function is called `c:handle_batch/3`. This function
  receives a `Nx.Batch` and returns a function to execute.
  The function itself must return a two element-tuple: the batched
  results and some server information. The server information can
  be any value and we set it to the atom `:server_info`.

  Now let's give it a try by defining a serving with our module and
  then running it on a batch:

      iex> serving = Nx.Serving.new(MyServing, :unused_arg)
      iex> batch = Nx.Batch.stack([Nx.tensor([1, 2, 3])])
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, batch)
      {:debug, #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [1, 2, 3]
        ]
      >}
      #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [2, 4, 6]
        ]
      >

  From here on, you use `start_link/1` to start this serving in your
  supervision and even customize `client_preprocessing/1` and
  `client_postprocessing/1` callbacks to this serving, as seen in the
  previous sections.

  Note in our implementation above assumes it won't run partitioned.
  In partitioned mode, `c:init/3` may receive multiple `defn_options`
  as the third argument and `c:handle_batch/3` may receive another partition
  besides 0.

  Runs the given `input` on the serving process given by `name`.

  `name` is either an atom representing a local or distributed
  serving process. First it will attempt to dispatch locally, then it
  falls back to the distributed serving. You may specify
  `{:local, name}` to force a local lookup or `{:distributed, name}`
  to force a distributed one.

  The `client_preprocessing` callback will be invoked on the `input`
  which is then sent to the server. The server will batch requests
  and send a response either when the batch is full or on timeout.
  Then `client_postprocessing` is invoked on the response. See the
  module documentation for more information. In the distributed case,
  the callbacks are invoked in the distributed node, but still outside of
  the serving process.

  Note that you cannot batch an `input` larger than the configured
  `:batch_size` in the server.

  ## Distributed mode

  To run in distributed mode, the nodes do not need to run the same
  code and applications. It is only required that they run the
  same `Nx` version.

  If the current node is running a serving given by `name` locally
  and `{:distributed, name}` is used, the request will use the same
  distribution mechanisms instead of being handled locally, which
  is useful for testing locally without a need to spawn nodes.

  This function receives an optional `distributed_preprocessing` callback as
  third argument for preprocessing the input for distributed requests. When
  using libraries like EXLA or Torchx, the tensor is often allocated in memory
  inside a third-party library so it is necessary to either transfer or copy
  the tensor to the binary backend before sending it to another node.
  This can be done by passing either `Nx.backend_transfer/1` or `Nx.backend_copy/1`
  as third argument:

      Nx.Serving.batched_run(MyDistributedServing, input, &Nx.backend_copy/1)

  Use `backend_transfer/1` if you know the input will no longer be used.

  Similarly, the serving has a `distributed_postprocessing` callback which can do
  equivalent before sending the reply to the caller.
