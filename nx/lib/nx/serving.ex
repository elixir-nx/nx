defmodule Nx.Serving do
  @moduledoc """
  Serving encapsulates client and server work to perform batched requests.

  Servings can be executed on the fly, without starting a server, but most
  often they are used to run servers that batch requests until a given size
  or timeout is reached.

  More specifically, servings are a mechanism to apply a computation on a
  `Nx.Batch`, with hooks for preprocessing input from and postprocessing
  output for the client. Thus we can think of an instance of `t:Nx.Serving.t/0`
  (a serving) as something that encapsulates batches of Nx computations.

  ## Inline/serverless workflow

  First, let's define a simple numerical definition function:

      defmodule MyDefn do
        import Nx.Defn

        defn print_and_multiply(x) do
          x = print_value(x, label: "debug")
          x * 2
        end
      end

  The function prints the given tensor and doubles its contents.
  We can use `new/1` to create a serving that will return a JIT
  or AOT compiled function to execute on batches of tensors:

      iex> serving = Nx.Serving.new(fn opts -> Nx.Defn.jit(&MyDefn.print_and_multiply/1, opts) end)
      iex> batch = Nx.Batch.stack([Nx.tensor([1, 2, 3])])
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, batch)
      debug: #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [1, 2, 3]
        ]
      >
      #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [2, 4, 6]
        ]
      >

  We started the serving by passing a function that receives
  compiler options and returns a JIT or AOT compiled function.
  We called `Nx.Defn.jit/2` passing the options received as
  argument, which will customize the JIT/AOT compilation.

  You should see two values printed. The former is the result of
  `Nx.Defn.Kernel.print_value/1`, which shows the tensor that was
  actually part of the computation and how it was batched.
  The latter is the result of the computation.

  When defining a `Nx.Serving`, we can also customize how the data is
  batched by using the `client_preprocessing` as well as the result by
  using `client_postprocessing` hooks. Let's give it another try,
  this time using `jit/2` to create the serving, which automatically
  wraps the given function in `Nx.Defn.jit/2` for us:

      iex> serving = (
      ...>   Nx.Serving.jit(&MyDefn.print_and_multiply/1)
      ...>   |> Nx.Serving.client_preprocessing(fn input -> {Nx.Batch.stack(input), :client_info} end)
      ...>   |> Nx.Serving.client_postprocessing(&{&1, &2})
      ...> )
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, [Nx.tensor([1, 2]), Nx.tensor([3, 4])])
      debug: #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[2][2]
        [
          [1, 2],
          [3, 4]
        ]
      >
      {{#Nx.Tensor<
          s64[2][2]
          [
            [2, 4],
            [6, 8]
          ]
        >,
        :server_info},
       :client_info}

  You can see the results are a bit different now. First of all, notice that
  we were able to run the serving passing a list of tensors. Our custom
  `client_preprocessing` function stacks those tensors into a batch of two
  entries and returns a tuple with a `Nx.Batch` struct and additional client
  information which we represent as the atom `:client_info`. The default
  client preprocessing simply enforces a batch (or a stream of batches)
  was given and returns no client information.

  Then the result is a triplet tuple, returned by the client
  postprocessing function, containing the result, the server information
  (which we will later learn how to customize), and the client information.
  From this, we can infer the default implementation of `client_postprocessing`
  simply returns the result, discarding the server and client information.

  So far, `Nx.Serving` has not given us much. It has simply encapsulated the
  execution of a function. Its full power comes when we start running our own
  `Nx.Serving` process. That's when we will also learn why we have a `client_`
  prefix in some of the function names.

  ## Stateful/process workflow

  `Nx.Serving` allows us to define an Elixir process to handle requests.
  This process provides several features, such as batching up to a given
  size or time, partitioning, and distribution over a group of nodes.

  To do so, we need to start a `Nx.Serving` process with a serving inside
  a supervision tree:

      children = [
        {Nx.Serving,
         serving: Nx.Serving.jit(&MyDefn.print_and_multiply/1),
         name: MyServing,
         batch_size: 10,
         batch_timeout: 100}
      ]

      Supervisor.start_child(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  > Note: in your actual application, you want to make sure
  > `Nx.Serving` comes early in your supervision tree, for example
  > before your web application endpoint or your data processing
  > pipelines, as those processes may end-up hitting Nx.Serving.

  Now you can send batched runs to said process:

      iex> batch = Nx.Batch.stack([Nx.tensor([1, 2, 3]), Nx.tensor([4, 5, 6])])
      iex> Nx.Serving.batched_run(MyServing, batch)
      debug: #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[2][3]
        [
          [1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6]
        ]
      >
      #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[2][3]
        [
          [2, 4, 6],
          [8, 10, 12]
        ]
      >

  In the example, we pushed a batch of 2 and eventually got a reply.
  The process will wait for requests from other processes, for up to
  100 milliseconds or until it gets 10 entries. Then it merges all
  batches together and once the result is computed, it slices and
  distributes those responses to each caller.

  If there is any `client_preprocessing` function, it will be executed
  before the batch is sent to the server. If there is any `client_postprocessing`
  function, it will be executed after getting the response from the
  server.

  ### Partitioning

  You can start several partitions under the same serving by passing
  `partitions: true` when starting the serving. The number of partitions
  will be determined according your compiler and for which host it is
  compiling.

  For example, when creating the serving, you may pass the following
  `defn_options`:

      Nx.Serving.new(computation, compiler: EXLA, client: :cuda)

  Now when booting up the serving:

      children = [
        {Nx.Serving,
         serving: serving,
         name: MyServing,
         batch_size: 10,
         batch_timeout: 100,
         partitions: true}
      ]

  If you have two GPUs, `batched_run/3` will now gather batches and send
  them to the GPUs as they become available to process requests.

  > #### Cross-device operations {: .warning}
  >
  > When `partitions: true` is set, you will receive results from
  > different GPU devices and Nx won't automatically transfer data
  > across devices to avoid surprising performance pitfalls, which
  > may lead to errors. In such cases, you probably want to transfer
  > tensors back to host on your serving execution.

  ### Distribution

  All `Nx.Serving`s are distributed by default. If the current machine
  does not have an instance of `Nx.Serving` running, `batched_run/3` will
  automatically look for one in the cluster. The nodes do not need to run
  the same code and applications. It is only required that they run the
  same `Nx` version.

  The load balancing between servings is done randomly by default, however,
  the number of partitions are considered if the `partitions: true` option is also given.
  For example, if you have a node with 2 GPUs and another with 4, the latter
  will receive the double of requests compared to the former.

  Furthermore, the load balancing allows for assigning weights to servings.
  Similarly to the number of partitions, when running a serving with `distribution_weight: 1`
  and another one with `distribution_weight: 2`, the latter will receive double the requests
  compared to the former.

  `batched_run/3` receives an optional `distributed_preprocessing` callback as
  third argument for preprocessing the input for distributed requests. When
  using libraries like EXLA or Torchx, the tensor is often allocated in memory
  inside a third-party library so it is necessary to either transfer or copy
  the tensor to the binary backend before sending it to another node.
  This can be done by passing either `Nx.backend_transfer/1` or `Nx.backend_copy/1`
  as third argument:

      Nx.Serving.batched_run(MyDistributedServing, input, &Nx.backend_copy/1)

  Use `backend_transfer/1` if you know the input will no longer be used.

  Similarly, the serving has a `distributed_postprocessing` callback which can do
  equivalent before sending the reply to the caller.

  The servings are dispatched using Erlang Distribution. You can use
  `Node.connect/1` to manually connect nodes. In a production setup, this is
  often done with the help of libraries like [`libcluster`](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster).

  ## Advanced notes

  ### Module-based serving

  In the examples so far, we have been using the default version of
  `Nx.Serving`, which executes the given function for each batch.

  However, we can also use `new/2` to start a module-based version of
  `Nx.Serving` which gives us more control over both inline and process
  workflows. A simple module implementation of a `Nx.Serving` could look
  like this:

      defmodule MyServing do
        @behaviour Nx.Serving

        defnp print_and_multiply(x) do
          x = print_value({:debug, x})
          x * 2
        end

        @impl true
        def init(_inline_or_process, :unused_arg, [defn_options]) do
          {:ok, Nx.Defn.jit(&print_and_multiply/1, defn_options)}
        end

        @impl true
        def handle_batch(batch, 0, function) do
          {:execute, fn -> {function.(batch), :server_info} end, function}
        end
      end

  It has two functions. The first, `c:init/3`, receives the type of serving
  (`:inline` or `:process`) and the serving argument. In this step,
  we capture `print_and_multiply/1`as a jitted function.

  The second function is called `c:handle_batch/3`. This function
  receives a `Nx.Batch` and returns a function to execute.
  The function itself must return a two element-tuple: the batched
  results and some server information. The server information can
  be any value and we set it to the atom `:server_info`.

  Now let's give it a try by defining a serving with our module and
  then running it on a batch:

      iex> serving = Nx.Serving.new(MyServing, :unused_arg)
      iex> batch = Nx.Batch.stack([Nx.tensor([1, 2, 3])])
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, batch)
      {:debug, #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [1, 2, 3]
        ]
      >}
      #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[1][3]
        [
          [2, 4, 6]
        ]
      >

  From here on, you use `start_link/1` to start this serving in your
  supervision and even customize `client_preprocessing/1` and
  `client_postprocessing/1` callbacks to this serving, as seen in the
  previous sections.

  Note in our implementation above assumes it won't run partitioned.
  In partitioned mode, `c:init/3` may receive multiple `defn_options`
  as the third argument and `c:handle_batch/3` may receive another partition
  besides 0.

  ### Streaming

  `Nx.Serving` allows both inputs and outputs to be streamed.

  In order to stream inputs, you only need to return a stream of `Nx.Batch`
  from the `client_preprocessing` callback. Serving will automatically take
  care of streaming the inputs in, regardless if using `run/2` or `batched_run/2`.
  It is recommended that the streaming batches have the same size as `batch_size`,
  to avoid triggering `batch_timeout` on every iteration (except for the last one
  which may be incomplete).

  To stream outputs, you must invoke `streaming/2` with any additional
  streaming configuration. When this is invoked, the `client_postprocessing`
  will receive a stream which you can further manipulate lazily using the
  functions in the `Stream` module. `streaming/2` also allows you to configure
  hooks and stream values directly from `Nx.Defn` hooks. However, when hook
  streaming is enabled, certain capabilities are removed: you cannot stream
  inputs nor have batches larger than the configured `batch_size`.

  You can enable both input and output streaming at once.

  ### Batch keys

  Sometimes it may be necessary to execute different functions under the
  same serving. For example, sequence transformers must pad the sequence
  to a given length. However, if you are batching, the length must be
  padded upfront. If the length is too small, you have to either discard
  data or support only small inputs. If the length is too large, then you
  decrease performance with the extra padding.

  Batch keys provide a mechanism to accumulate different batches, based on
  their key, which execute independently. As an example, we will do a
  serving which performs different operations based on the batch key,
  but it could also be used to perform the same operation for different
  templates:

      iex> args = [Nx.template({10}, :s64)]
      iex> serving = Nx.Serving.new(fn
      ...>   :double, opts -> Nx.Defn.compile(&Nx.multiply(&1, 2), args, opts)
      ...>   :half, opts -> Nx.Defn.compile(&Nx.divide(&1, 2), args, opts)
      ...> end)
      iex> double_batch = Nx.Batch.concatenate([Nx.iota({10})]) |> Nx.Batch.key(:double)
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, double_batch)
      #Nx.Tensor<
        s64[10]
        [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
      >
      iex> half_batch = Nx.Batch.concatenate([Nx.iota({10})]) |> Nx.Batch.key(:half)
      iex> Nx.Serving.run(serving, half_batch)
      #Nx.Tensor<
        f32[10]
        [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5]
      >

  When using a process-based serving, you must specify the supported
  `:batch_keys` when the process is started. The batch keys will be
  available inside the `defn_options` passed as the third argument of
  the `c:init/3` callback. The batch keys will also be verified
  when the batch is returned from the client-preprocessing callback.

  to stream `Nx.Defn` hooks.

  ## Options

    * `:hooks` - a list of hook names that will become streaming events

  ## Implementation details

  ### Client postprocessing

  Once streaming is enabled, the client postprocessing callback
  will receive a stream which will emit events for each hook
  in the shape of:

      {hook_name, term()}

  The stream will also receive events in the shape of
  `{:batch, output, metadata}` as batches are processed by the
  serving. The client postprocessing is often expected to call
  `Stream.transform/3` to process those events into something
  usable by callers.

  If the `:hooks` option is given, only a single `:batch` event
  is emitted, at the end, as detailed next.

  ### Batch limits

  If you are streaming hooks, the serving server can no longer break
  batch and you are unable to push a payload bigger than `:batch_size`.
  For example, imagine you have a `batch_size` of 3 and you push three
  batches of two elements (AA, BB, and CC). Without hooks, the batches
  will be consumed as:

      AAB -> BCC

  With streaming, we can't break the batch `BB`, as above, so we will
  consistently pad with zeroes:

      AA0 -> BB0 -> CC0

  In practice, this should not be a major problem, as you should
  generally avoid having a batch size that is not a multiple of the
  most common batches.

  Starts a `Nx.Serving` process to batch requests to a given serving.

  ## Options

  All options, except `:name` and `:serving`, can also be set via
  `process_options/2`.

    * `:name` - an atom with the name of the process

    * `:serving` - a `Nx.Serving` struct with the serving configuration

    * `:batch_keys` - all available batch keys. Batch keys allows Nx.Serving
      to accumulate different batches with different properties. Defaults to
      `[:default]`

    * `:batch_size` - the maximum batch size. A default value can be set with
      `batch_size/2`, which applies to both `run/2` and `batched_run/2`.
      Setting this option only affects `batched_run/2` and it defaults to `1`
      if none is set. Note batches received by the serving are not automatically
      padded to the batch size, such can be done with `Nx.Batch.pad/2`.

    * `:batch_timeout` - the maximum time to wait, in milliseconds,
      before executing the batch (defaults to `100`ms)

    * `:partitions` - when `true`, starts several partitions under this serving.
      The number of partitions will be determined according to your compiler
      and for which host it is compiling. See the module docs for more information

    * `:distribution_weight` - weight used for load balancing when running
      a distributed serving. Defaults to `1`.
      If it is set to a higher number `w`, the serving process will receive,
      on average, `w` times the number of requests compared to the
      default. Note that the weight is multiplied with the number of
      partitions, if partitioning is enabled.

    * `:shutdown` - the maximum time for the serving to shutdown. This will
      block until the existing computation finishes (defaults to `30_000`ms)

    * `:hibernate_after` and `:spawn_opt` - configure the underlying serving
      workers (see `GenServer.start_link/3`)

  @doc """
  Runs the given `input` on the serving process given by `name`.

  `name` is either an atom representing a local or distributed
  serving process. First it will attempt to dispatch locally, then it
  falls back to the distributed serving. You may specify
  `{:local, name}` to force a local lookup or `{:distributed, name}`
  to force a distributed one.

  The `client_preprocessing` callback will be invoked on the `input`
  which is then sent to the server. The server will batch requests
  and send a response either when the batch is full or on timeout.
  Then `client_postprocessing` is invoked on the response. See the
  module documentation for more information. In the distributed case,
  the callbacks are invoked in the distributed node, but still outside of
  the serving process.

  Note that you cannot batch an `input` larger than the configured
  `:batch_size` in the server.

  ## Distributed mode

  To run in distributed mode, the nodes do not need to run the same
  code and applications. It is only required that they run the
  same `Nx` version.

  If the current node is running a serving given by `name` locally
  and `{:distributed, name}` is used, the request will use the same
  distribution mechanisms instead of being handled locally, which
  is useful for testing locally without a need to spawn nodes.

  This function receives an optional `distributed_preprocessing` callback as
  third argument for preprocessing the input for distributed requests. When
  using libraries like EXLA or Torchx, the tensor is often allocated in memory
  inside a third-party library so it may be necessary to either transfer or copy
  the tensor to the binary backend before sending it to another node.
  This can be done by passing either `Nx.backend_transfer/1` or `Nx.backend_copy/1`
  as third argument:

      Nx.Serving.batched_run(MyDistributedServing, input, &Nx.backend_copy/1)

  Use `backend_transfer/1` if you know the input will no longer be used.

  Similarly, the serving has a `distributed_postprocessing` callback which can do
  equivalent before sending the reply to the caller.
