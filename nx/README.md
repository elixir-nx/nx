Nx is a multi-dimensional tensors library for Elixir with multi-staged compilation to the CPU/GPU. Its high-level features are:

  * Typed multi-dimensional tensors, where the tensors can be unsigned integers (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`), signed integers (`s8`, `s16`, `s32`, `s64`), floats (`f32`, `f64`) and brain floats (`bf16`);

  * Named tensors, allowing developers to give names to each dimension, leading to more readable and less error prone codebases;

  * Automatic differentiation, also known as autograd. The `grad` function provides reverse-mode differentiation, useful for simulations, training probabilistic models, etc;

  * Tensors backends, which enables the main `Nx` API to be used to manipulate binary tensors, GPU-backed tensors, sparse matrices, and more;

  * Numerical definitions, known as `defn`, provide multi-stage compilation of tensor operations to multiple targets, such as highly specialized CPU code or the GPU. The compilation can happen either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT) with a compiler of your choice;

You can find planned enhancements and features in the issues tracker. If you need one particular feature to move forward, don't hesitate to let us know and give us feedback.

For Python developers, `Nx` currently takes its main inspirations from [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/) and [`JAX`](https://github.com/google/jax) but packaged into a single unified library.

## Installation

In order to use `Nx`, you will need Elixir installed. Then create an Elixir project via the `mix` build tool:

```
$ mix new my_app
```

Then you can add `Nx` as dependency in your `mix.exs`. At the moment you will have to use a Git dependency while we work on our first release:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nx, "~> 0.1.0-dev", github: "elixir-nx/nx", branch: "main", sparse: "nx"}
  ]
end
```

## Examples

Let's create a tensor:

```elixir
iex> t = Nx.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
iex> Nx.shape(t)
{2, 2}
```

To implement [the Softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function)
using this library:

```elixir
iex> t = Nx.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
iex> Nx.divide(Nx.exp(t), Nx.sum(Nx.exp(t)))
#Nx.Tensor<
  f32[2][2]
  [
    [0.032058604061603546, 0.08714432269334793],
    [0.23688282072544098, 0.6439142227172852]
  ]

```

## Numerical definitions

By default, `Nx` uses pure Elixir code. Since Elixir is a functional and immutable language, each operation above makes a copy of the tensor, which is quite innefficient.

However, `Nx` also comes with numerical definitions, called `defn`, which is a subset of Elixir tailored for numerical computations. For example, it overrides Elixir's default operators so they are tensor-aware:

```elixir
defmodule MyModule do
  import Nx.Defn

  defn softmax(t) do
    Nx.exp(t) / Nx.sum(Nx.exp(t))
  end
end
```

`defn` supports multiple compiler backends, which can compile said functions to run on the CPU or in the GPU. For example, [using the `EXLA` compiler](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla), which provides bindings to Google's XLA:

```elixir
@defn_compiler {EXLA, client: :host}
defn softmax(t) do
  Nx.exp(t) / Nx.sum(Nx.exp(t))
end
```

Once `softmax` is called, `Nx.Defn` will invoke `EXLA` to emit a just-in-time and high-specialized compiled version of the code, tailored to the input tensors type and shape. By passing `client: :cuda` or `client: :rocm`, the code can be compiled for the GPU. For reference, here are some benchmarks of the function above when called with a tensor of one million random float values:

See the [`bench`](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/bench) and [`examples`](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/examples) directory inside the EXLA project for more information.

`defn` relies on a technique called multi-stage programming, which is built on top of Elixir functional and meta-programming capabilities: we transform Elixir code to emit an AST that is then transformed to run on the CPU/GPU. Ultimately, the `defn` compiler is pluggable, which means developers can implement bindings for different tensor compiler technologies and choose the most appropriate one.

Many of Elixir features are supported inside `defn`, such as the pipe operator, aliases, conditionals, pattern-matching, and more. Other features such as loops and in-place updates are on the roadmap. `defn` also support `transforms`, which allows numerical definitions to be transformed at runtime. Automatic differentiation, via the `grad` function, is one example of transforms.
