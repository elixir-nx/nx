  An EXLA Buffer.

  An EXLA Buffer is the data passed as input and retrieved as output to/from EXLA Executables. An EXLA
  Buffer consists of two things:

    1) A Binary
    2) A reference to an `xla::ScopedShapedBuffer`

  An `xla::ScopedShapedBuffer` is an "owning" wrapper around an `xla::ShapedBuffer`. Shaped Buffers are just
  buffers of data with an underlying XLA shape. Scoped Shaped Buffers are said to be an "owning" wrapper because
  they represent an allocated portion of memory on a specified device (like a GPU) owned by that device. Device
  memory is allocated upon creation of the `xla::ScopedShapedBuffer` and deallocated upon it's destruction.
