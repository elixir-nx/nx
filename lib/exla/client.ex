  # The Python XLA API offers 3 additional methods for client creation:
  # `get_cpu_client`, `get_nvidia_gpu_client`, and `get_tpu_client`. They essentially
  # wrap the method below with preset configurations, allocators, etc. that work out
  # of the box with CPU/GPU/TPU respectively. This has the benefit of giving the user
  # a guaranteed working client without having to mess around with specifying a device,
  # allocator, etc. For example, the current Naive Allocator as it's set up and configured
  # doesn't work with GPU. We would need to set up some special configurations for that
  # to work. We can give the user the ability to fully customize their setup around this
  # function, but also offer the more convenient and safer `get_[device]_client` methods.
  # Alternatively, we can keep this method private, and only expose the 3 client device
  # creation methods, with limited, but safer configuration options.
