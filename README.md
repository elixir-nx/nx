This repository currently holds the following projects:

  * [`Nx`](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/nx#readme) - Multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) and numerical definitions for Elixir

  * [`EXLA`](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla#readme) - Elixir client for Google's XLA with Nx compiler integration and JIT/AOT compilation to the CPU/GPU

  * [`Torchx`](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/torchx#readme) - Elixir client to LibTorch with Nx backend integration

Each has their own README, which you can access above to learn more. They will be extracted to their own repository in the future. Examples and benchmarks are available in the `EXLA` project.
